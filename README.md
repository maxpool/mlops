# Let's write on MLOps ü§ñ

Launching -&gt; [mlops.design](http://mlops.design/)

I guess we all know about the book "Data science on AWS". The book is a great collection on how to leverage Sagemaker on AWS. What if there existed a book about MLOps on different cloud and not just limited to Sagemaker? 

This book is meant to be a collaborative effort in this direction. The idea started as a [discussion ](https://twitter.com/nlpguy_/status/1405065105482522624)on how to deploy models but without Sagemaker. Although I am now convinced that a better way is to discuss all patterns and let the user decide.

With this, I want to invite you to write and share your learnings. You can reach out to me on [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/nlpguy_)or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhavsarpratik/). The proposal should consist of - Title, what, why and table of content. You can create an issue in the [repo ](https://github.com/maxpool/mlops/issues)itself for submitting the proposal. If you have already written on this, we can also crosspost it with reference to the original üòÑ

Topics we want to cover:

* Data processing
* Model training 
* Model evaluation
* Model serving 
  * Server
  * Batch
  * Serverless
* Online experimentation
* Model monitoring 
* ML pipelines 
* Model registry 
* Dataset and feature repository
* Frameworks for ML

We discuss a lot of NLP & MLOps on [Maxpool](http://maxpool.club/). Come[ join.maxpool.club](http://join.maxpool.club/) üëãüèº
